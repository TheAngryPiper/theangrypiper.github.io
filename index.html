         <h2>Hi, I’m Gerry — a solutions-driven technologist with a creative streak.</h1>
          <p>
            I’ve spent the last couple of decades helping businesses run smarter, faster, and more human. Whether I’m building customer-facing AI tools, refining web platforms, or automating behind-the-scenes chaos, my goal is the same: make things that work, and work well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring a background in full-stack development, conversational AI, and process optimization — with a side interest in design, music, and the occasional woodworking project. My approach blends logic and empathy, code and conversation.
          </p>

            Have a look around. If you’re curious about how I think or what I’ve built, you’re in the right place. Check in with my personal bot assistant by clicking the icon under the Bagpiping Cat to the right.

       <p>For the past five years, I’ve worked with AI agents and automation in conversational commerce, collaborating with numerous Fortune 500 companies. I have extensive experience building customer-facing bots that enhance engagement and streamline interactions.</p>
        <P>Here are a few sites showcasing just a handful of the many bots I’ve designed and launched. Look for the "Contact us" or "Message us" type buttons to start talking to these interactive bots:</P>

    <li><a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview#messageUs" target="blank">Delta Airlines</a></li>

</ul>
        <p>I have also built bots for many large FiServ customers. If you have a login for any of the following banks, you can see my bots at work in their authenticated space:</p>

       <!-- <h1>A Short Story, to be continued ...</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was this kid. He was pretty normal ... or so it seemed.</p>
        <p>One day as he was walking along the edge of a grassy field, he looked up.</p>
        <p>There was nothing strange to see up there, just a slow lazy cloud drifting by on the high summer breeze.</p>
        <p>But he was perplexed and mesmerized, for no particular reason.</p>
        <p>As the cloud slowly crept across the sky, he had the sudden feeling that the cloud was standing still and it was the ground beneath him that was moving.</p>
        <p>And that changed everything ...</p>
