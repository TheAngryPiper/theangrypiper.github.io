        <div>Welcome to my new GitHub-based site.</div>
        <div>Rebuilding from scratch, so please be patient.</div>

        <p>There will be more intersting content here soon.</p>
        <p>Maybe some pictures. Maybe some video. Maybe some crazy AI bot that wants to tell dirty jokes.</p>
        <p>Who can say ... let's wait and see.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time, there was this kid. He was pretty normal ... or so it seemed.</p>
        <p>One day as he was walking along the edge of a grassy field, he looked up.</p>
        <p>There was nothing strange to see up there, just a slow lazy cloud drifting by on the high summer breeze.</p>
        <p>But he was perplexed and mesmerized, for no particular reason.</p>
        <p>As the cloud slowly crept across the sky, he had the sudden feeling that the cloud was standing still and it was the ground beneath him that was moving.</p>
        <p>And that changed everything ...</p>
